You should write necessary socket programming code (in C) to implement the following:

There will be a server and client program.

The client after establishing a connection with the server will be sending a message to the server.

The server after receiving the message sends the same message back to the client.

You should display the message in both terminals that runs server and client.

It is recommended that you should try both sock_stream and sock_dgram socket.
